## üìî Introduction

Explore Landmarks is a reference application for HMS Kits to phones running with the android based
HMS Service. Explore Landmark app is provides you to learn more information about the landmark
detected from an image given by you. It scans your image and recognizes landmark that exists in the
image. After that, the app gives you information about the landmark. And also it provides you to
view panoramic images and panoramic videos about the landmark. Additionally, the app provides an
image gallery that contains a lot of images related to the recognized landmark from the image given

-----
Thanks to [Huawei Keyring Service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-keyring/) you
can list, save, delete and share user credentials in this app. Keyring offers the Credentials
Management API for storing user credentials locally on Android phones and tablets and sharing them
between different apps and different platform versions of an app. For understanding how keyring is
used in this app you can look at Authentication Fragment and related classes with it.

## ‚ùì Let's Try the App - What You Will Need

- A computer that can run Android Studio üòä.
- An android device with Hms Core installed and OS version Android 7 or higher (minSdk is API 24)
- Fork this repo by clicking top right and clone it to your computer.
- You need to AGConnect-Services.json file to run this project properly. Follow the below steps to
  obtain it.
  - [Create Huawei Developer Account if you haven't got an account](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/start/10104)
  - Go to the app-level build.gradle file and change the application id of the project. (You don't need to change the package name in the whole repo.)
  - [Create a SignIn Certificate with key0 alias, ExploreLandmarks password and named as ExploreLandmarks.jks](https://medium.com/@corruptedkernel/android-creating-a-signing-certificate-keystore-and-signing-your-apk-fa67fdd27cf)
    . Actually this password and alias are not mandatory but if you want to sign with different
    alias or password please don't forget to change needed information in build.gradle (app:level)
    to with new information. Replace this file with ExploreLandmarks.jks which already exist on the
    app directory.
  - [Generate SHA-256 Fingerprint via Keytool](https://medium.com/@corruptedkernel/android-generating-fingerprint-from-a-keystore-jks-file-b624bacd90fd)
    or running the signingReport task (View => Tool Windows => Gradle => Tasks => Android =>
    signingReport)
  - Login to [Huawei Developer Console](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/console) if you
    didn't log in.
  - [Create a new  app with the new applicationId in AppGallery and integrate the repo with it](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/android-integrating-your-apps-with-huawei-hms-core-1f1e2a090e98) (
    Creating an app, adding SHA-256 to AppGallery Connect, Downloading AgConnectServices.json file)
  - Before downloading agconnect-services.json choose a Data Processing Location on Project Settings
    -> General Information (I recommended Germany because I use it and the search feature is worked
    properly with it.).
  - Before downloading and moving agconnect-services.json file to the "app" folder,
    please [make enable necessary services](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-help-enabling-service-0000001146598793)
    . For this project you have to set enable Auth Service, Account Kit, ML Kit, Search Kit, Keyring
    Service, Analytics Kit.
- You need to client id and client secret to obtain an access token from Account Kit via OAuth-based
  authentication. [Get this information](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-help-appinfo-0000001100014694)
  under Project Settings => General Information => App information => OAuth 2.0 client ID section
  and add them into app level build.gradle file.
- [You need to app id for Search Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/integrating-sdk-0000001057023645)
  . Take the "app_id" value from the agconnect-services.json file and set it to the AGC_APP_ID_VALUE
  value in the application level build.gradle file.
- [You need to add the API key for using ML Kit on cloud services](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/hiai-Guides/add-appgallery-0000001050038080)
  Take the "api_key" value from the agconnect-services.json file and set it to the API_KEY_VALUE
  value in the application level build.gradle file.
- Solution of some issues you might be faced
  - Error Code 907135000 : Please move agconnect-services.json file under to app directory.
  - Error Code 6003 : [Enable App Signing by choosing "Let AppGallery Connect create and manage app signature for me"](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-appsigning-newapp-0000001052418290)
